Heya, I'm Atora. I write code for fun and/or money. FOSS and dice enthusiast.

I currently know (well), in order of preference:

|💙| Typescript, Rust, Docker |
| - | - |
|❤️| Javascript, SQL, C# |
|😃| Java, Python |
|😕| PHP |
|🥺| The NPM Ecosystem |

+ Many others I am either not _super_ experienced in or am just not a fan of using (sorry C devs.) PHP is an exception because [some](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.real-escape-string.php) [of the](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.real-connect.php) [design](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php) [choices](http://phpsadness.com/) are so baffling to me it lives rent-free in my head.

HTML/CSS depend on how many hours I've been trying to align boxes for.
