Heya, I'm Atora. I write code for fun and/or money. FOSS and dice enthusiast.

Not currently looking for work.

I currently know (well):

|💙| Typescript, Rust, Docker |
| - | - |
|❤️| Javascript, SQL, C# |
|😃| Java, Python |
|😐| PHP |
|🥺| The NPM Ecosystem |

And others I can't be bothered to list here.

HTML/CSS depend on how many hours I've been trying to align boxes for.

The best way to reach me about my code is by opening an issue on the repo.
